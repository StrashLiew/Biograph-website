			<h1 class="feature-title">Previous Work: Connect 4 AI</h1>
			<br>		
			<p>During the semester of 2104, my friends and I had developed an AI for a connect 4 game.
			   The AI was developed using Alpha-Beta pruning to help it make decisions. 
			   This game could be considered my first game that I developed or at least part of it. 
			   It really showed how complex and different everything behind the scenes was compared to what the user
			   was seeing and experiencing. I remember having a meltdown trying to integrate everything together. XD
			   </p>

		</div>	
		<div class="col-lg-10 col-md-10 col-sm-10 col-10 sec1">	
			<br>
			<p>Overall the game was not overly complicated to develop, however it proved to be a very interesting experience as
			   it was my first time developing an AI for a game to work as my opponent.
			   There were of course many bugs and difficulties along the way, but I am very satisfied with what 
			   my team and I have accomplished in this project, and it has proven to be a very memorable experience.</p>

			<h1 class="feature-title">Ongoing Work: 2D Roguelite</h1>	
			<br>
			<p>For my current project, I'm working on a 2D roguelite at the moment. When I first started out 
			on this, I was really excited as I was also playing another 2D roguelite game made by an indie developer
			that was really enjoyable and fun. It was called Vampire Survivors. I was really surprised how the 2D space
			and pixel designs can still capture the hearts and interests of the masses. It really motivated me
			to try develop my own 2D rougelite game.</p>

			<br>
			<p>Of course, this project is also part of another course, but that does not change how I feel about 
			the project. I'm really learning a lot through my journey with this project, especially regarding Unity.
			Needless to say endless bugs and difficulties will lay ahead of me, but I'm keeping optimistic about it.
			I'm really looking forward to what this end product will be like.

			<h1 class="feature-title">Future Plans: Develop own RPG</h1>
			<br>		
			<p>Truth be told, I am a massive fan of RPG games, especially JRPGs. It is a dream of mine to actually 
			develop an RPG of my own. I have thoroughly enjoyed my times with titles like Nier, FFXIV, Trails, Tales,
			and many other RPG series. They have kind of inspired me to try my hand at developing one of my own.</p>

			<br>
			<p>I know its a difficult career to survive in, especially in Malaysia. So I 
			don't think I will be making it as my main career, but more of a hobby that I one day hope to accomplish.
			I think for the near future it will only be something simple like a 2d pixel rpg in the old days. I know my work may not reach the heights of AAA games, but at the very least I want it to be 
			something I am proud of, something that I can proudly tell people that I made that game.</p>
